            &#8220;&#32;Alejandro, you&#x27;ve been a great leader that has consistently delivered and provided critical insights on how our platform should be built. Your vision to make our platform more scalable, more modern, and efficient has brought Switchfly out of the stone ages and into the 21st century. Even though we still have a long ways to improve, your attention to detail and work ethics have built an inspiring foundation for which to build on. You faced challenges head-on when assigned to poorly defined features, you focused on results when menial tasks had to be completed, and you always carried the spirit of the team with your humor/attitude. As an example: even though the platform team didn‚Äôt get pre-approval to upgrade UI component libraries, you delve into all 200 hours of POCs to give us the justification to make an informed and confident decision. That speaks volumes to your dedication, focus, and foresight‚Ä¶enforcing your status as a role model for others on the team. You have been a &quot;core&quot; part of our Core platform team. Any company or team would be extremely blessed to have you, your skills, and amazing attitude.&#32;&#8221;

Whenever we had a big new feature with many unknowns, we could trust Alejandro to do the initial research, proof of concept, and final implementation. He had a big hand in integrating a new calendar, dropdown form, and filter sliders into our app. The results were beautiful and modern. In addition, Alejandro has excellent communication skills and is an active participant during planning meetings. He is clear, concise, and helpful with his feedback.

            &#8220;&#32;Alejandro and I worked together as colleagues in Front End Engineering projects, and he is overall a very strong technical lead. Naturally a very curious and detailed oriented person, he often finds and discover new tech-related articles and ideas to keep the team thinking out of the box. As I spent a lot of time doing project-level non-technical tasks, I can always depend on Alejandro as my right-hand man to be able to execute and achieve very high-quality work on our projects, as well as on platform improvement work and proof-of-concepts. He is highly experienced and knowledgeable in many areas of Front End Engineering such as, JavaScript, build tools, semantic/usability markup, styling, accessibility, front end patterns and web-app performance. I have learned so much from him over the past few years working together, and it was very motivating to work with him. Aside from technical skills, Alejandro also has strong communication skills you&#x27;d find in a leader. He keeps an open mind that specs are not always perfect, and is not afraid to speak up during any time of the SDLC. He knows that things don&#x27;t end just because you&#x27;re done coding. In addition to being a Native Spanish speaker, Alejandro has Native-level English skills in reading and writing. All his verbal and written communication is very detail oriented. With his calm and patient demeanor, he is pleasant to work with, and is very dependable and accountable. With strong technical and communication skills, Alejandro is definitely someone I would like on my team, and is someone that you will definitely learn and grow together with.&#32;&#8221;

            &#8220;&#32;Alejandro is a great combination of both excellent technical prowess along w/ superb communication skills. I have managed Alejandro for 2 years and I know when I give him an assignment, it will be done on time and with high quality. He excels at raising issues and finding solutions and recommendations for a variety of issues. I would strongly recommend Alejandro and would jump at the chance to work with him again.&#32;&#8221;

            &#8220;&#32;It wasn&#x27;t long before Alejandro joined our team and became one of the leading front end developers. He is an expert in his domain as a web developer, but his ability reaches well beyond it. Alejandro is adept at solutioning, resolving issues the right way quickly. In addition to his technical strength, Alejandro communicates well and keeps his team laughing with his keen sense of humor. Who wouldn&#x27;t want him on their team? Come back to mine!&#32;&#8221;

            &#8220;&#32;Alejandro was easily one of the best developers I&#x27;ve collaborated with. He innately has a clear grasp of how to take business requirements and convert it to code, and it helped greatly that he was a front-end code aficionado, constantly keeping up with the best techniques and practices. I believe Alejandro will be successful at any organization, both with his technical savvy and his amicable personality.&#32;&#8221;
