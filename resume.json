Your vision to make our platform more scalable, more modern, and efficient has brought Switchfly out of the stone ages and into the 21st century. Even though we still have a long ways to improve, your attention to detail and work ethics have built an inspiring foundation for which to build on. You faced challenges head-on when assigned to poorly defined features, you focused on results when menial tasks had to be completed, and you always carried the spirit of the team with your humor/attitude. As an example: even though the platform team didn‚Äôt get pre-approval to upgrade UI component libraries, you delve into all 200 hours of POCs to give us the justification to make an informed and confident decision. That speaks volumes to your dedication, focus, and foresight‚Ä¶enforcing your status as a role model for others on the team. You have been a \"core\" part of our Core platform team. Any company or team would be extremely blessed to have you, your skills, and amazing attitude."
