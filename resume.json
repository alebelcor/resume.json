Alejandro is not only technically strong, but he also took the initiative to provide helpful feedback and look into new ways to accomplish challenging tasks. Whenever we had a big new feature with many unknowns, we could trust Alejandro to do the initial research, proof of concept, and final implementation. He had a big hand in integrating a new calendar, dropdown form, and filter sliders into our app. The results were beautiful and modern. In addition, Alejandro has excellent communication skills and is an active participant during planning meetings. He is clear, concise, and helpful with his feedback. It was a real pleasure working with him and having him as part of the team!"

Naturally a very curious and detailed oriented person, he often finds and discover new tech-related articles and ideas to keep the team thinking out of the box. As I spent a lot of time doing project-level non-technical tasks, I can always depend on Alejandro as my right-hand man to be able to execute and achieve very high-quality work on our projects, as well as on platform improvement work and proof-of-concepts. He is highly experienced and knowledgeable in many areas of Frontend Engineering such as, Javascript, build tools, semantic/usability markup, styling, accessibility, frontend patterns and web-app performance. I have learned so much from him over the past few years working together, and it was very motivating to work with him. Aside from technical skills, Alejandro also has strong communication skills you'd find in a leader. He keeps an open mind that specs are not always perfect, and is not afraid to speak up during any time of the SDLC. He knows that things don't end just because you're done coding. In addition to being a Native Spanish speaker, Alejandro has Native-level English skills in reading and writing. All his verbal and written communication is very detail oriented. With his calm and patient demeanor, he is pleasant to work with, and is very dependable and accountable. With strong technical and communication skills, Alejandro is definitely someone I would like on my team, and is someone that you will definitely learn and grow together with."
